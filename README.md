# Custom Midi Mixer plugin for automatically scorekeeping my slippi games

This project is unlikely going to work for anyone else without modification tbh.
Connects to an [8wr.io scoreboard](http://8wr.io/)

todo:
- Support offline game scorekeeping
  - Track players by port or something
- If possible support spectating games
